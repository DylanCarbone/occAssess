Description: Contains a number of discrete functions, each of which can be used to assess a particular form of bias, uncertainty or coverage. Generally, the user must pass
    their occurrence data to the functions along with a list of time periods into which the outputs will be split. The functions generally return a list with two elements: 
    a ggplot2 object, and the data that underpins that plot.
